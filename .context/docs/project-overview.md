# Project Overview

Celula-Connect is a web application built with Next.js and TypeScript to facilitate connections, organization, and communication within church cell groups (células) for Igreja 12. It solves the problem of coordinating community events, member tracking, and resource sharing in a religious context, benefiting church leaders, members, and administrators by providing an intuitive platform for engagement and growth.

## Quick Facts
- Root path: `C:\Users\hanie\OneDrive\Documentos\workspace\Mocha-projetc-Igreja-12\Celula-Connect`
- Primary languages detected:
  - .tsx (101 files)
  - .ts (96 files)
  - .md (31 files)
  - .js (14 files)
  - .sql (7 files)

## Technology Stack Summary
The project leverages Node.js as the primary runtime, TypeScript as the main language for type safety, and JavaScript for runtime compatibility. It targets web platforms via Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation. Build tooling includes npm for package management, ESLint for linting, and Prettier (inferred from common setups) for formatting. The infrastructure supports modern web development with hot reloading and optimized builds.

## Core Framework Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js (with React) for building dynamic, SEO-friendly web applications using server components and API routes.
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes for server logic, integrated with Prisma as the ORM for database interactions.
- **Data**: Prisma for schema definition and queries, supporting SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite based on schema.sql files); no explicit messaging layer, but potential for future integrations like WebSockets.
- **Architectural Patterns**: Component-based architecture with React patterns (hooks, contexts); layered design separating UI, business logic, and data access; enforces TypeScript for type-safe patterns and Prisma migrations for schema evolution.

## UI & Interaction Libraries
- **UI Kit**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, with potential shadcn/ui components (via components.json) for reusable UI elements like buttons and modals.
- **Design System**: Custom theming in tailwind.config.ts for church-themed colors and accessibility; follows ARIA standards for inclusive interactions; no explicit localization, but i18n can be added via Next.js.
- Contributors must adhere to Tailwind classes for consistency and ensure responsive design for mobile church group access.

## Development Tools Overview
Essential tools include npm for dependency management and running scripts (e.g., `npm run dev` for development server), Prisma CLI for database operations, and Playwright for browser testing. The setup supports VS Code with TypeScript extensions for an optimal environment. Link to [Tooling & Productivity Guide](./tooling.md) for deeper setup instructions.

## Getting Started Checklist
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Set up the database using `npx prisma generate` and `npx prisma db push` (or migrate as per PLANO_MIGRACAO.md).
3. Explore the app by running `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server at http://localhost:3000.
4. Review [Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md) for day-to-day tasks.

## Next Steps
Positioned as a community tool for Igreja 12's cell groups, key stakeholders include church admins for maintenance and members for daily use. External resources: Refer to PLANO_MIGRACAO.md and ACOMPANHAMENTO_MIGRACAO.md for migration details; product specs are evolving via issues in the repo. For demos, check the public/ directory assets.
